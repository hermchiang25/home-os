# Goals & Life Direction

*Last updated: February 28, 2026*

## Who I Am

Father of two pre-college young adults. Married. Later-stage career, approaching financial independence. I stay active daily through weightlifting, zone 2 cardio, and Brazilian jiu-jitsu (1-2x/week). Focused on building depth — in relationships, skills, and experiences that push my growth edge.

---

## What I'm Building Toward

**Connected relationships** — more present, more intentional, more aware with my wife and kids. Not just coexisting but actually connecting.

**Long-term health** — not just fitness today but building a body and mind that carries me for decades. Staying injury-free, consistent, and curious about what I'm capable of.

**Skills with leverage** — AI development at work and through side projects. Finding where my skills compound into something I'm genuinely passionate about and could sustain me beyond my current job.

**Financial independence** — investments and side projects aligned with my interests that could carry me after I leave my current role.

**Growth through discomfort** — leaning into things that are hard and sometimes uncomfortable (BJJ, technical projects out of my comfort zone like building AI evaluation systems). That's where the interesting stuff happens.

## Success Criteria

### In 12 months, I'll know this was a successful year if:

- My relationships with my wife and kids feel noticeably more connected and intentional
- I've maintained my health routines consistently — lifting, zone 2, BJJ — without major injury
- I've shipped at least one meaningful AI project, at work or as a side hustle
- My path to financial independence is clearer and actively progressing
- I leaned into at least one thing that made me uncomfortable and came out better for it

## Current Priorities (Top 3)

### 1. Connected Relationships
More awareness and practice in how I show up with my wife and kids. Not just presence — actual quality of attention and care.

### 2. Long-Term Health
Daily movement as a non-negotiable. Weightlifting, zone 2, BJJ. Recovery, sleep, nutrition as supporting structures.

### 3. Financial Independence + Side Projects
Managing investments intentionally. Exploring AI side projects that align my skills and interests — things I'd want to do regardless of the money, but that could eventually generate income and carry me post-career.

## This Quarter (Next 90 Days)

- Build at least one consistent relationship practice (recurring quality time with wife, 1:1s with each kid)
- Maintain health routine — no weeks off, stay injury-aware in BJJ
- Define and start one AI side project (even just a prototype or proof of concept)
- Review investment portfolio and clarify milestones toward financial independence

## Priority Framework

Use this when deciding what goes in the task list:

**P0 — Do today** (max 3):
- Health: urgent appointments, injury management
- Family: time-sensitive commitments, things that matter to them today
- Finance: overdue or deadline-driven tasks

**P1 — This week** (max 7):
- Weekly relationship rituals — quality time with wife, check-ins with kids
- Health routine maintenance — don't let streaks break
- Active AI project work
- Financial tasks with near-term deadlines

**P2 — This month**:
- Home maintenance and improvements
- Learning and skill building
- Financial planning and portfolio reviews
- Habit experiments and new routines to try

**P3 — Someday**:
- Wishlist ideas
- Speculative side project concepts
- Nice-to-haves with no deadline or urgency

*Review and update this monthly as priorities shift.*
